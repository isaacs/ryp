A really super scaled down featureless node package manager.

Named after Ryan Dahl, because he complained enough to make this happen,
and in my attempt to shut him up, I accidentally built something neat
and decided that I kinda liked it.

Put this script somewhere.  Then run `ryp` in your package folder.

What results doesn't work yet, and doesn't handle all the different edge
cases that npm will, but it does the 90% use case pretty ok.

It requires perl and bash and curl and a bunch of other shell scripting tools.
